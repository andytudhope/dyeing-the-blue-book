Hear him cry,  
o worthy reciter.  
Surely your tears have the ring  
of truth.  
  
Meanwhile,  
the whales have returned  
to our wide bay to breed;  
giants of the deep undergoing  
their own soul journey,  
stopped here  
for the love of what you read,  
a book revealed  
for all the worlds.  
  
Might and mercy  
on a straight path   
from the water's heart,  
all in thrall before the throne.
